Hello,

Hi, I am Joel DSouza, a small time blogger, infact I have just started, Jekyll enables me to set a site up in few minutes. 

Alright, I will tell you guys a bit about me.

I am 26, from Mumbai, India. I love programming and learning new things and methods that can help me be better. This blog is just an ode to that hunger for knowledge and incessant apetite of being pedantic for becoming better in my field.
